| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Docker           | To avoid installing unnecessary things on computer     |
| Ffmpeg           | Try to use ffmpeg without backend                      |
| React            | To practice writing with this technology               |
| Eslint, prettier | Not to think about code makeup (works well in vs code) |
| Scss             | Easier to use BEM                                      |
| Gh-pages         | To put it on the Github                                |
